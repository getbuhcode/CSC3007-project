                <p>
                  This Sankey graph is designed by Enrique Mendoza Tincopa to visualize the best-selling video game consoles
                  based on the worldwide Sales per Company on different regions.
                </p>
            
                <p class="h4 text-dark">Data (What):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The representation of the data on the graph contains too much information and confusing visuals at first
                    glance. Viewers would need to look closely to focus on which wave represent the console and which company
                    it originate from.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are 3 main data to be focused on based on the graph, which is the Region, Company, and platform.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Region & Company:</b> Categorical Data</li>
                    <li><b>Platform total (Console sold):</b> Quantitative Data</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
            
                <p class="h4 text-dark">Idiom (How):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It uses the thick waves (curves) to illustrate the amount of sales linking the three main categories
                    (Region, Company & Platform) which can be confusing, as the waves are intercepting one another with
                    different colours making it difficult for the user to follow the trend/pattern. The trend or pattern is
                    not obvious from the visualisations to know which region, company or platform has the best sales, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are too many types of console under the platform category which is splitted according to the black
                    dotted lines, the separation of the types of console is not distinct or space out enough for the users to
                    easily figure out which colour waves falls under which types of console.
                  </li>
                  <li>The middle section (Company) is unnecessary as the legend already depict the company it belongs to.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p class="h4 text-dark">Improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We can represent the datas in a bar chart as shown in the reference.</li>
                  <li>A drop-down list can allow the viewer to select the company or comparison of all companies.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Consoles will be sorted based on their company.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Color can be used to show the region that the console is sold on, and each bar will show the number of
                    console sold in millions.
                  </li>
                  <li>If doing a comparison, console names will be color coded based on their company to differentiate.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  This graph is designed by user, maps_us_eu, to visualize the importance of religion for the population
                  between the United States and European Union.
                </p>
            
                <p class="h4 text-dark">Data (What):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The data is represented using a block map of the different states in the United states and the different
                    countries in the European Union. This makes it hard to read and find specific states/countries as they all
                    look similar.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The block map also fails to effectively show the population distribution between different
                    states/countries as they are all the same sized blocks.
                  </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p class="h4 text-dark">Idiom (How):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The percentage range used in the legend is quite limited, most of the percentages in the United States are
                    represented by blue and purple.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Also Alabama looks worse than every state in the United States with 77% but Mississippi is only 3%
                      lesser than Alabama.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    The colors used in the legend has 3 different dark colors and only 1 light color which makes it harder to
                    judge which color is representing a higher percentage than the others.
                  </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p class="h4 text-dark">Improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We can represent the data in a heat map.</li>
                  <li>
                    The higher the percentage the darker the colour will be, and each colour will represent either the
                    European Union or United States.
                  </li>
                  <li>When hovering over the countries/states in the map, the percentage can be shown to user.</li>
